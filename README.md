Our process.
We did a great job. Our website consists of many components. Everywhere we used three files with html/css/js extensions.

Built with HTML5 Semantic markup, customizable CSS properties, and an internal JavaScript programming language style that allows you to create dynamically updated content.
I want to keep focusing on developing ideas for future projects. I want to improve and manage the priority of tasks.But, in our opinion, the main thing is to approach the project consciously and try to use professional tools and approaches that you have learned about.That is why the constant development and pumping of yourself allows you to be ready for any situations to solve problems. But, of course, we understand that the focus of attention can vary depending on our desire and direction.

Useful resources

https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Learn/JavaScript - This is an amazing site that helped me finally understand. I would recommend this to anyone who is still learning this
JavaScript concept.
